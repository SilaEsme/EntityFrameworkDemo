## Entity Framework Demo
This project is the desktop application which you can display, update and delete the products from a table. 
> This project is about how Entity Framework works.
### Database Configure
 To try the project, you must configure the database settings. 
 You must write your local ==connection string== in "*App.config*" file.

    <connectionStrings>
        <add name="TradeContext" 
             connectionString="Server=YourLocalName;Database=YourDatabase;integrated security=True;"
             providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/>
	</connectionStrings>



 If any problem occurs while running the project, you can contact with me.
